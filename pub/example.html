        <p>This is a text checker library, the developer will design rules that clients need to follow</p>
        <p>Enter "a", click check, you will encounter the first rule, animation is shaking and there is a gif-like
            toturial teaching

        <p>Enter "UofT_a", click check, you will encounter the second rule, animation is shaking, follow the rule and

            there is a
            gif-like

        <h2>Future work and charllanges</h2>
        <p>Future work would be making more intuitive animations, better tutorial and maketutorial modules that</p>
        <p> would enable developer to custome their own toturial</p>
        <p>Challanges I have is to coordinate with the textbox since it is not part of the library but the library works
            around it.</p>
